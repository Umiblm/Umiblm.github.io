Research Experience	
======
**Prof Hugh Markus, Dr Eric Harshfield, Stroke Research Group, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK (10.2022 - now)**\
Using observational and genetic data to investigate causal relationship between sleep and stroke
* Big data analysis to genetic data (genome-wide association studies) to sleep characteristics through University cloud server 
* In Python, analyzed UK Biobank observational data and found significant association between sleep and stroke
* Performed causal analyses to genetic data and found association between insomnia and ischemic stroke
* The manuscript has been accepted to the journal “Neurology” (doi: https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.104183)
  
**Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Lab, Imperial College London, London, UK (02.2021 - 08.2021)**\
Investigate brain structure and its relationship to behaviour in trichotillomania (TTM) and skin picking disorder (SPD)
* Pre-processed the T1 structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data using Freesurfer and FSL software, extracted different brain metrics (grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and fractional anisotropy).
* Used a principle component analysis to identify important brain regions (e.g. fronto-striatal circuits) underlying the pathophysiology of TTM and SPD.
* Performed correlation analysis to see the differential brain-behavior relationship across groups.
* Applied machine learning regression to predict clinical severity of TTM patients based on their brain metrics.

**Cracking the Neural Code Program, Schnitzer’s Group, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA (04.2020 - 08.2020)**\
Large-scale transcriptomic analysis to investigate genes underpin interaction between microbiota and depression
* Analyzed bulk tissue mRNA sequencing data from antidepressant, microbiota, or double treated mice
* Isolated cell type specific genes based on differential expression patterns  
* Identified overlapped genes (Kcna2, Slc12a5) within neuron and microglia cells affected by treatments which could be the target for depression treatment 


Intern Experience & Extracurricular Activities
======
**NetEase Hangzhou Network Co Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (07.2022 - 10.2022)**\
*Game Designer (System designer)*
* Participated the development of mini-game “Lotus Cake (打蓮糕)” for mid-autumn festival activities
* Responsible for planning the game procedure and implementation
* Involve the development of client side using Unity 3D scripting 
* The mini game has been widely praised on SNS, Players’ participant rates for this game has improved to 35% compared to previous events (23%).
