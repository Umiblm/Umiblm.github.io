Education
======
* PhD in Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, 2022-2025
* Msc in Translational Neuroscience, Imperial College London, 2020-2021
* Bachelor of Medical Science in Physiology, University of Sydney, 2016-2019

Awards & Honors
======
* Ranked in the top 5% of majors in 2016-2019 Academic year (GPA 3.96) and won scholarship "**Deans' list of Academic Excellence**".
* 25000 pounds/year scholarship funded by supervisor Professor Hugh Markus in Cambridge University.



Research Experience	
======

**Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Lab, Imperial College London, London, UK (02.2021 - 08.2021)**
Investigate brain structure and its relationship to behaviour in trichotillomania (TTM) and skin picking disorder (SPD)
* Pre-processed the T1 structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data using Freesurfer and FSL software, extracted different brain metrics (grey matter volume, cortical thickness, and fractional anisotropy).
* Used a principle component analysis to identify important brain regions (e.g. fronto-striatal circuits) underlying the pathophysiology of TTM and SPD.
* Performed canonical correlation analysis to see the differential brain-behavior relationship across groups.
* Applied machine learning regression to predict clinical severity of TTM patients based on their brain metrics.

**Cracking the Neural Code Program, Schnitzerâ€™s Group, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, USA (04.2020 - 08.2020)**
Large-scale transcriptomic analysis to investigate genes underpin interaction between microbiota and depression
* Isolated cell type specific (astrocyte, neuron, microglia) genes, showing differential gene expression patterns affected by antidepressant and microbiota treatment.
* Applied partial-least squares regression finding overlapped genes (Kcna2, Slc12a5) within neuron and microglia cells affected by treatments which could be the target for further mechanistic investigation.


Intern Experience & Extracurricular Activities
======
**NetEase Hangzhou Network Co Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China (07.2022 - 10.2022)**
*Game Designer (System and battle design)*
* Mini-game design for mid-autumn patch in Yimeng Jianghu 
Participated in the summer internship in NetEase H42 Department and worked as a system designer, responsible for the new game of the Mid-Autumn Festival activity of Yimeng Jianghu (originally Chu Liuxiang). The mini game "Playing Lotus Cake" planned by the myself has been widely praised on the social media (Weibo, Red).
